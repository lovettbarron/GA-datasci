# GA Data Sci Prep
Prep material for the General Assembly Data Science course.
Wanting to keep a diary of sorts for the class.

##### Context coming in:
- C++ and web-oriented full stack
- Limited python experience (wrote a game once)
- Last six months have been primarily research or managerial, not nearly as much code as I'd like.

### Prep books
- Data Science from Scratch
- Data Analysis with Python
- Learn Python the Hard Way[http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/]

- Gallery of iPython Notebook[https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#programming-and-computer-science]
