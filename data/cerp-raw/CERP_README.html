<h2>Commander&#39;s Emergency Response Program Data -- Raw FOIA file</h2>

<h3>Released January 2015</h3>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This is raw data released to ProPublica under a Freedom of Information Act. The data was culled together from several different databases by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). (You can read more about the databases <a href="https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/special%20projects/SIGAR-15-49-SP.pdf">here</a>.) This means there are, in many cases, both duplicate records and duplicate fields. The best way to deal with the duplicate records is to filter the field &quot;Same Report&quot; to 0 (zero). The field &quot;Report Key Repeats&quot; shows how many times the record is repeated in the database.</p>

<p>Also,&nbsp;this database was entered by field personnel, and&nbsp;contains some&nbsp;estimates, errors and misspellings. Report with caution when using this data.&nbsp;For more information on&nbsp;the contents of this database, contact SIGAR&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sigar.mil/contact/index.aspx?SSR=9">here</a>.</p>
