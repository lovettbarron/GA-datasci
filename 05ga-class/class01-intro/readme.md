**1: What is Data Sci**
Statistics, computation, and storytelling
How do you tell a story with data?
"analysis of data using the scientific method (it may be the most overused term of the year, but you're ulikely to have a meeting where the topic odesn't come up)" [Shelly Palmer]

Without the storytelling side, you're screwed: Venn diagram (Stat/Comp/Knowledge)

Interdisciplinary, problem-solving oriented subject

"Data scientist is a data analyst who lives in california"
"Data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer, and better at software engineering than a statistician"
"Data scientist is a business analyst who lives in New York"
"Data scientist is a statistician who lives in SF"
"Statistics on a mac"

Data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data

Engineering skills to acquire and manage large data sets, and statistician skills to extract value from large data sets and present that data to a large audience - John Rauser
